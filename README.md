This was a project released to the cfx community in june of 2017. Over the years it has had a few alterations but nothing that made it to the main file on the post, requiring some labor to get it all put together. After a suggestion was made to make it a github for any potential PR changes, I decided to release my alterations here as well. 

Please note, that I am not the *best* at coding, with just under a year of experience I can for the most part get things done, but they might not be the best or the cleanest (though I do try!). If you need to contact me - for what ever that may be, (but only if it pertains to this) BrianTU#0001 is my discord.

# Current Change Log
    2017-06-12 FiveM Heli Cam by mraes, version 1.3
    2017-06-23 Modified by rjross2013
    2017-08-15 Further modified by Loque with credits to the following for tips gleaned from their scripts: Guadmaz's Simple Police Searchlight, devilkkw's Speed Camera, nynjardin's Simple Outlaw Alert and IllidanS4's FiveM Entity Iterators.
    2018-04-22 Vehicle Info Expanded to include street names by LoirdKillmore
    2018-07-03 Vehicle Info Expanded to include heading by Torch
    2019-02-09 Rappel Landing fix by Robbster
    2022-09-01 Combined previous updates, added multiple-helicopter support, one person use, no rear-seat access (to camera), checks and balances and key-disable (for when in camera use) by BrianTU#0001 

# Currently Known Bugs
    - Sometimes the camera will get stuck in the "in use status", not sure what causes it but, it happens. 
    - Extended text on the information tracking tends to be cut off
    - The "fix" to prevent the character from landing on their face from rappelling did not work.

# Original Description
## mraes’ Heli Script
Formerly known as HeliCam

# Description
  This resource adds the Helicam from that one single player mission back to FiveM.
  Complete with working compass and altimeter, night vision and thermal vision.
  It also gives vehicle information and is able to lock onto vehicles.
  If that wasn’t enough, it also synchronizes the helicopter searchlight and allows passengers to rappel from any helicopter.

# Instructions
    Download the resource and put it in the resources' folder.
    Press the E key to switch to the HeliCam
    Whilst in Helicam:
    Move mouse to rotate cam
    Scroll to zoom
    RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON to switch between normal, night vision and thermal vision
    Whilst in Helicam: when hovering over a vehicle and close enough to it, you can see vehicle info. If you can see this, press SPACE to lock the camera onto the vehicle. SPACE again to unlock camera.
    Press the X key to rappel from the helicopter
    Press the G key as helicopter pilot to switch on the spotlight (this is synced across the network to all players)

(All keys mentioned here are the default keys bound to the controls the script uses. See the source if you need to change them)
Please make suggestions or changes, I’m open to feedback.
If you make any changes, please release them to the community as well :slight_smile:

Have fun!
ps Et pour les francophones la même chose.
